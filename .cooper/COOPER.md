# Cooper 🛢️🐒

**Cooper** is a unified **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** framework that merges **OpenSpec's Living Spec Deltas** with **Conductor's** quality governance and **[Troop's](https://github.com/twoBoots/troop)** worktree isolation.

## Planning Architecture: The Two-Tier Model

Cooper cleanly isolates architectural design from tactical code execution:

1. **Upstream Alignment (`cooper-rfc`)**:
   - For epics, major refactors, multi-system changes, or initiatives requiring team consensus.
   - Spawns `.worktrees/rfc-<name>`, drafts `rfc.md` + cross-capability `spec-deltas/`, and opens a **Draft Pull Request** with structured reviewer guidance.
   - Review loop synthesizes PR discussions and automatically detects approval via GitHub Native Review (`reviewDecision == "APPROVED"`) or `/approve` comment triggers.
   - Upon approval, the agent registers decomposed child tracks in `.cooper/tracks.md`, transitions the PR to Ready for Review (`gh pr ready`), and pauses for human maintainer merge to `main`.
2. **Downstream Execution (`cooper-new-track` & `workflow.md`)**:
   - For single-capability features, bug fixes, or child tracks decomposed from an approved RFC.
   - Spawns `.worktrees/<track_id>`, drafts tactical `plan.md` and spec deltas, runs strict TDD (Red -> Green -> Refactor), records Git Notes, and syncs checkpoints.

## The SDD Track Lifecycle

### 1. Spawn Isolated Track Worktree (`cooper-new-track`)
Never write feature code directly on `main`. Start an isolated worktree with Troop:
```bash
git agent-start <track_id>
```
This checks out a dedicated worktree at `.worktrees/<track_id>`.

### 2. Inspect Living Capability Specs
Before designing new features or bug fixes, read existing capability specifications:
```
.cooper/specs/<capability>/spec.md
```

### 3. Create Track Proposal, Design & Spec Deltas
Inside `.worktrees/<track_id>/.cooper/active/<track_id>/`:
* `proposal.md`: Summary of changes, intent, and value.
* `design.md`: Technical architecture and implementation details.
* `spec-deltas/<capability>/spec.md`: Requirement diffs using `+` (additions) and `-` (removals) in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format.
* `plan.md`: Step-by-step TDD task checklist organized into Phases.

### 4. Execute Tasks with TDD & Git Notes (`cooper-implement`)
Follow the strict TDD cycle:
1. **Red**: Write failing unit tests.
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make tests pass.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and ensure coverage meets threshold (>80%).
4. **Git Note**: Attach task execution notes to the commit:
   ```bash
   git notes add -m "Task summary: <details>" <commit_hash>
   ```
5. **Update Plan**: Update task in `plan.md` to `[x] Task (commit_hash)`.

### 5. Phase Completion & Checkpoint
At the end of each Phase in `plan.md`:
1. **Sync**: Run `git fetch origin main` to pull latest workflow rules and living specs.
2. **Verify**: Run the full test suite (`CI=true npm test`).
3. **Checkpoint**: Commit and attach verification notes, then push:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "cooper(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X"
   git notes add -m "<verification_report>" <checkpoint_hash>
   git push origin <track_id>
   ```

### 6. Code Review, Pull Request & Teardown (`cooper-review`)
1. Review implementation against Spec Deltas and styleguides.
2. Submit PR via GitHub CLI: `gh pr create --body-file prbody.md`.
3. Once merged, Spec Deltas integrate into `.cooper/specs/` and active tracks move to `.cooper/archive/`.
4. Teardown the isolated worktree:
   ```bash
   git agent-stop <track_id>
   ```
